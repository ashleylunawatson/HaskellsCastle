# HaskellsCastle
Terminal game written in Haskell based on the game Helen's Mysterious Castle.

Type `ghci HaskellsCastle` into a terminal to play.

Just in case you don't actually want to play the game, at the main menu, hit **Continue**, then load Sv1.txt.
This is a save file with a weapon called the **IDHTFTS Sword** that will kill any enemy in one hit, just in case you don't have time to grind enemies to level up your utilities.
